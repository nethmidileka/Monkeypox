                    <h2>WHAT IS MONKEYPOX?</h2>
					
                    <p>Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus is part of 
					   the same family of viruses as variola virus, the virus that causes smallpox. Monkeypox symptoms are similar to 
					   smallpox symptoms, but milder, and monkeypox is rarely fatal. Monkeypox is not related to chickenpox.

                       Monkeypox was discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in 
					   colonies of monkeys kept for research. Despite being named “monkeypox,” the source of 
					   the disease remains unknown. However, African rodents and non-human primates (like monkeys) might harbor 
					   the virus and infect people.

                       The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970. Prior to the 2022 outbreak, monkeypox had been 
					   reported in people in several central and western African countries. Previously, almost all monkeypox cases in 
					   people outside of Africa were linked to international travel to countries where the disease 
                       commonly occurs or through imported animals. These cases occurred on multiple continents.</p>

                    <p>After exposure, it may be several days to a few weeks before you develop symptoms. Early signs of monkeypox include flu-like symptoms, including:
                        <ul>
						   <li> Fever.</li>
                           <li>Chills.</li>

                <h1>DIAGONOSIS AND TEST</h1>				
				<p>			
					Because monkeypox is rare, 
					a healthcare provider may first suspect other rash illnesses,
					such as measles or chickenpox. <br>
					But swollen lymph nodes usually distinguish monkeypox from other poxes.
